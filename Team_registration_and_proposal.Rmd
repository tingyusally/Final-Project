#### Project title
Data-Driven Insights for Community Safety in Los Angeles: Analyzing Crime Patterns and Trends in Recent Years

#### Motivation/ Statement of Purpose
Los Angeles is a city of vibrant diversity and a lively urban landscape—but it’s also a city where the dynamics of crime can vary widely across neighborhoods, demographic groups, and even times of day. For law enforcement, policymakers, and community members alike, understanding these complex crime patterns is key to fostering safer and more resilient communities.\
Our project dives into the Los Angeles Police Department crime dataset to uncover the "who, what, where, and when" of crime across LA's diverse neighborhoods. We're on a mission to decode the patterns of crime by exploring how different demographics, time frames, and locations shape the city's unique crime profile. Whether it's catching late-night trends, uncovering hotspots, or spotlighting demographic factors, we’re here to map the hidden story of LA’s crime scene and uncover what drives certain areas' steady patterns—or sudden disruptions!
 
#### Intended final product
After completing the project, we will present all data analysis results in the form of a website, including interactive visualizations and tables containing various data insights.
 
#### Data sources
This is a dataset of recent crime data from Los Angeles, covering a wide range of crime types, from violent crimes like homicide and assault to property crimes like theft and burglary. The data is carefully organized, providing insights into crime trends, geographic differences, and temporal patterns. The dataset can be downloaded directly from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitsinghaiml/u-s-crime-dataset/data.
 
#### Analyses/ Visualizations
Our planned analyses using the Los Angeles Police Department crime dataset include the following:\

1. **Victim Demographics**: Examining potential disparities across age, gender, and racial groups.\
2. **Temporal Trends of Crime**: Analyzing trends in crime occurrence across different years and months, as well as examining the frequency of incidents by day and by time of day.\
3. **Primary Locations of Crime**: Conducting a multivariate association analysis, incorporating factors such as time to identify key types of crime locations.\
4. **Geospatial Mapping of Crime**: Using latitude and longitude data to display crime severity on mobile-friendly interactive maps.\

#### Coding challenges
1. Large amount of data and high number of missing values in some varibale.\
2. There are numerous region/case type codes that need data type conversion.\
3. Generating a neat and informative website.
